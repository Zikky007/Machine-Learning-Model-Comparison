# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison
This project compares different implementations of identically-named machine learning techniques across multiple datasets. It aims to identify performance variations and dataset-specific effectiveness, ensuring consistent empirical design and reproducibility. 
The project focuses on comparing the effectiveness of two (technically four) machine learning techniques using three sizable datasets. This comparative analysis aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of how different implementations of identically named machine learning techniques perform and how the characteristics of various datasets impact these techniques. The project is structured to address two main research questions:
Research Question 1 (RQ1): Do different implementations of identically named machine learning techniques perform exactly the same? If not, which implementations are outstanding for specific empirical designs and evaluation measures?
Research Question 2 (RQ2): How do the datasets employed in this work differ from each other? Specifically, what are the differences in characteristics among the three datasets that could impact the effectiveness of machine learning techniques?
